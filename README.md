# ACM Latex Template 2017
- This is a modified version of ACM 2017 LaTex template.
- The purpose is to remove unnecessary space and fields in the submission.
- The project is tested on Overleaf, so no Makefile is provided.

WARNING: This is customized mainly for computer science field
conferences and journals, especially for EDA and architecture,
but you're welcome to contribute more changes to make it compatible
to others.

## Changelist
- Use global numbering for theorems instead of sections.
- Enforce author first names in reference section to be initial.
- The maximum displayed author number can be adjusted by modifying
ACM-Reference-Format.bst:1028
- The author list that contains "others" will be transformed to "et al"
automatically.

## TODO
- None.
